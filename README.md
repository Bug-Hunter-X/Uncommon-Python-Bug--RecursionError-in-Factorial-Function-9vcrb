This repository contains examples demonstrating and resolving an uncommon Python bug: RecursionError. The `bug.py` file showcases a recursive factorial function that triggers this error for large inputs. The `bugSolution.py` file offers a corrected iterative implementation.  This error isn't always immediately obvious and often requires careful analysis of the function's behavior, particularly when handling potentially very large inputs.
